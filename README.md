This is a user edit of the Wanderer's Gambling Addon for World of Warcraft, which I found here, https://addonswow.com/wanderers-gambling.

Updated for interface version 100000.

Description taken from above link:

```This addon is an update of Cross Gambling which itself is an update to GC Gambler.
Original owned/maker of the addon Myrx from Gentlemen's club. https://gcguild.net/pages/gcgambler/
Last known updater of Cross Gambling Flúttêrshy of <Nostalgia> on Whisperwind-US

```
**Description**
```This is a gambling addon that requires users to roll the amount of gold they wish to bet.
The winnings and losses are calculated from the difference between the highest and lowest numbers rolled.
Optional 10% house cut. We use it for guild repairs and raid mats.
Optionally the loser can set the next gamble amount.
```
**Example**
```Deathspree rolls 9320 (1-10000)
Entity rolls 5606 (1-10000)
Powerthirst rolls 6378 (1-10000)
GotGames rolls 7234 (1-10000)
Deathspree owes Entity 3343 gold and the guild bank 371 gold.
Deathspree can set the next gamble amount by typing !amount x.
```
**Instructions**
```The number in the middle of the screen is the amount you're going to roll for.
Clicking [Open Entry] will start the game
Anyone who wishes to join just has to type 1 in either raid chat or guild chat (depending on which one you set it to)
Next you will click [Last Call] to post a final notification to those who wish to join the game.
Finally [ROLL!] will enable to game and allow those who are playing's rolls to be tracked.
(For the addon owner, you will need to click [Enter's For You] to join the game, and [User Roll] to roll your dice)
Clicking [ROLL!] again during rolling phase will enable the addon to notify the names of those who have not rolled yet.
Upon everyone rolling, the addon will automatically post the winner / loser in chat.
Players may whisper the person running the mod with !stats to see their win/loss stats.
